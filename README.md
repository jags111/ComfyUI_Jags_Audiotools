# *Sample generator*  Tools to train a generative model on arbitrary audio samples

A big shout out and thanks to the wonderful work done on Sample diffusion by Harmonai and a lot of core code is ported from same to this repo and any queries on the working for same can be linked to the repo ass shown here. <a href ="https://github.com/Harmonai-org/sample-generator"> **sample-generator** </a>

### Features

Allows the use of trained dance diffusion/sample generator models in ComfyUI.

Also included are two optional extensions of the extension (lol); Wave Generator for creating primitive waves aswell as a wrapper for the Pedalboard library.

The pedalboard wrapper allows us to wrap most vst3s and control them, for now only a wrapper for OTT is included. Any suggestions are welcome.

Includes a couple of  helper functions.

### Dependencies


check Notes for more information.

## **Install:**
To install, drop the "_**ComfyUI_Jags_Audiotools**_" folder into the "_**...\ComfyUI\ComfyUI\custom_nodes**_" directory and restart UI.<br>

But the best method is to install same from ComfyUI Manager (https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) and search for this name in the Node list and install from there and restart the UI as it takes care of all the dependencies and installs and make it easy for you.
